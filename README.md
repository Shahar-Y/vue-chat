# vue-socket-game

## Running the game:
- `node nodeServer/app.js`
- `cd client`
- `npm run serve`
- open http://localhost:8080 with several windows to see the socket updates  in real-time

#### Use WASD for moving

##### Using circleci for CI


Created just for POC with sockets and circleci

TODO: remove the `server.close();` from app.js and make tests work
